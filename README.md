1. How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
  In order to ensure that my code is functional and secure, I made sure to manually review my code and unit test it. Manual testing helped to refine the logic and ensure cohesive operation. Unit testing helped to ensure function and proper error catching.

2. How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
   In order to interpret user needs, usability testing or beta testing is one way to collect feedback and refine development. Also, reviewing your code with another collaborator or seperate team can help get a better idea of how a new user may react to the program.
   
3. How do I approach designing software?
  The first step is to collect and define requirements. Once they are collected, you can begin to build the program's skeleton and test key features to ensure they meet the requirements. Once the skeleton is complete, refinement can begin.
